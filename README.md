# Data modeling course

Prerequisites for this course is fundamental SQL including

- querying
- filtering
- aggregations
- joins

In this course we'll dive into concepts of data modeling such as

- conceptual, logical, physical data models
- relational model
- relational database concepts such as constraints, normalization
- constraints, primary key, foreign key
- entity relationship modeling (ERD)
- designing and implementing relational databases in SQL

For this you will be using the following tools:
