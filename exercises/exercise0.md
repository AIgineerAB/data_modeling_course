# Exercise 0 - fundamental concepts of data modeling

These exercises are for you to learn fundamental concepts in data modeling. Many of them can be done with pen and paper, physical whiteboard or with an ERD software such as Lucidchart. It is good practice to work analogue as an important part of data modeling is to align various stakeholders with a mix of technical and business knowledge. It is also advised to discuss with your peers as data modeling usually is not done in solitude.

## 0. Library Bookly

A library called Bookly keeps track of books and members who borrow them. Each book has a title, author, and ISBN number. Each member has a membership ID, name, and contact information. A member can borrow multiple books, but each book can be borrowed by only one member at a time.

a) Identify the `entities` and `attributes` for each entity.

b) Determine the `relationship` between member and books.

c) Draw a `conceptual ERD` using crow foots notation.

a) Describe the entities in this conceptual ERD. 

b) Write out the relationship labels. 

c) Describe the relationships between the entities (one-to-many, one-to-one and many-to-many).
