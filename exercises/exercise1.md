# Exercise 0 - fundamental concepts of data modeling

These exercises are for you to learn fundamental concepts in data modeling. Many of them can be done with pen and paper, physical whiteboard or with an ERD software such as Lucidchart and dbdiagram. It is good practice to work analogue as an important part of data modeling is to align various stakeholders with a mix of technical and business knowledge. It is also advised to discuss with your peers as data modeling usually is not done in solitude.
